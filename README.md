# Book Nook - Back End 📚
We're happy to present Book Nook – a website that allows students, job seekers, and employees to track and rate their favorite study spots. Users create or sign in to an account to record a study spot's noise levels, access to outlets, wifi strength, and overall ambiance. Should they desire, users can access, edit, and also delete their reviews. Happy studying!

## User Stories 🗣
As a student, job seeker, or employee...
-I want to find record study spots near my current location

-Rate study spots based on ambiance (noise level, aesthetic)
-Reference, edit, and delete previous reviews on their experience at that study spot

## Challenges 💪
This project was an exciting opportunity to build a full-stack application for the first time, as well as work in a team. A few roadblockers we encountered were GitHub workflow errors, implementing tokens, and navigating complex axios requests. We hoped to incorporate a 3rd party API, but ultimately did not end up having enough time to implement OAuth. Ultimately, we have produced a project we are proud of and learned so much from this experience.

## What's Next 🏁
Thinking about where we could take this project, our goals would be to implement a location-based 3rd party API to allow users to search study spots by location and study spot category.

## Reflection 🙌
Developing Book Nook was an incredible learning experience, both working as a team and creating our first full-stack project! We worked as a team to overcome many new challenges, and it was a pleasure to collaborate on this project. Cheers!
